#   Charity Navigator

##### OverView: 
Founded in 2001, Charity Navigator has become the nation's largest and most-utilized evaluator of charities. In their quest to help donors, their team of professional analysts has examined tens of thousands of non-profit financial documents. They have used this knowledge to develop an unbiased, objective, numbers-based rating system to assess over 9,000 of America's best-known and some lesser known, but worthy, charities.

##### Objective:

The objective of this project is to map organizations focused on aiding migrants/refugees/asylum seekers coming to US borders.
